# My-Python-Projects

Welcome to my personal repository of Python projects and exercises! ðŸ‘‹

This is where I document my Python learning journey through **hands-on mini-projects**, focusing on **basic syntax, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and working with JSON data**.

---

### **Main Goals:**

* **Track Completed Projects:** Store and review what I've built so far.
* **Reinforce & Apply Knowledge:** Practice Python skills and concepts through each project.

---

### **Repository Structure**

Currently, this repository includes the following project:

* **`Todo_List_App/`**
    * A simple task management application demonstrating OOP principles and basic data persistence (e.g., using JSON for task storage).
